# test-store-76

# This is the second half of a two-part web app.

According to the description I wrote for the npm package, this is a "Minimalist HTTP CRUD(-esque) API service implemented with ExpressJS."

It has since grown to include an asynchronous endpoint testing suite.

The data store is raw JSON in text files. The API serves data through ExpressJS using the 'application/json' content type.

The front-end repo for this project has been creatively titled "[Test App](https://github.com/quantumtom/test-app)" by its author.
