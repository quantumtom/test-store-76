# test-store-76

According to the description I wrote for the npm package, this is a "Minimalist HTTP CRUD service with ExpressJS."

It has since grown to include an asynchronous endpoint testing suite.

The data store is raw JSON in text files. The API serves data through ExpressJS using the 'application/json' content type.

The front-end repo for this project lives at https://github.com/quantumtom/test-app.
